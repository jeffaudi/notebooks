        "\n",
        "In recent years, artificial intelligence has made great strides in the field of computer vision. One area that has seen particularly impressive progress is object detection, with a variety of deep learning models achieving high levels of accuracy. However, this abundance of choice can be overwhelming for practitioners who are looking to implement an object detection system.\n",
        "\n",
        "On top of this, most public models and academic research are benchmarked on COCO which are dataset made of photographs. Satellite images are quite different from photographs: the objects to detect are usually much smaller and much more numerous, they are oriented in all kind of direction and acquired in slightly different colors. In photographs, trees are always seen as green objects with the trunk below the foliage. But not in aerial or satellite images.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, if a model architecture performs well on a photographic dataset, it does not mean that it will perform as well on an aerial dataset. And finding vehicles, wind turbines, buildings, roads, floods or crops are very different tasks. How can one find which model will work best for their data and application? In many cases, it is necessary to experiment with a few different models before finding the one that gives the best results for the specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        "How can we test many architectures?\n",
        "In this notebook, we will use the open source IceVision framework to experiment with different model architectures and compare their performance on a dataset representing the desired task i.e. finding aircrafts in satellite imagery.\n",
